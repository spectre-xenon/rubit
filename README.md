## About The Project

So, I was feeling kind of geeky one day and decided I wanted to really get how the internet works under the hood. I'm always down to learn something new, and messing around with a low-levelish language sounded like fun. That's when it hit meâ€”why not try building a BitTorrent client with Rust?

It's not perfect (yet!), but let me tell you, this whole thing has been a wild ride through the awesome (and sometimes confusing) world of bytes and streams!

## Installation

If you have rust installed you can get it easily with:

```sh
 cargo install rubit-cli
```

_alternatively you can get the executable for your system from the releases tab._

## Usage

To start a download use the following command

```sh
rubit -t <path to .torrent file>
```

To specify an output location and name you can for example use

```sh
rubit -t <path to .torrent file> -o ~/Download/test.mkv
```

And finally if you find the download speed too slow you can us the `-i` flag to change the interval (in Seconds) at which the client requests new peers from the tracker
